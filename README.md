# ngraph.native

C++ implementation of force-based layout from ngraph. This is equivalent to
[ngraph.offline.layout](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.offline.layout).
Unfortunately I don't have bindings to nodejs (yet).

# How to build:
git clone https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.native
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ../ngraph.native
make
