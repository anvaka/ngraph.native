# ngraph.native

C++ implementation of force-based layout from ngraph.<br>
This is equivalent to [ngraph.offline.layout](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.offline.layout)<br>
Unfortunately I don't have bindings to nodejs (yet).

# How to build:
> git clone https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.native<br>
> mkdir bin<br>
> cd bin<br>
> cmake ../ngraph.native<br>
> make
