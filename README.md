# ngraph.native

C++ implementation of force-based layout from ngraph. This is equivalent to
[ngraph.offline.layout](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.offline.layout).
Unfortunately I don't have bindings to nodejs (yet).

## Usage

Simply clone the repository and run `make`! 

Once compiled, run with:`./bin/layout++ path_to_links.bin [path_to_positions.bin]`

My C++ is very much rusty, please feel free to contribute if you find something
to improve.
